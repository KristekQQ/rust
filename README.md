# WebGPU in Rust via WebAssembly

This repository contains a minimal example of using WebGPU from Rust
compiled to WebAssembly. The example clears a canvas with a color
inside the browser.

## Building

Install the WebAssembly target for Rust and build with `wasm-pack`:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Install `wasm-pack` if it is not already available.
# (Do **not** include this comment after the command.)
cargo install wasm-pack

wasm-pack build --target web
```

This will create a `pkg/` directory with the generated JavaScript and
WebAssembly files.

## Running

Serve the `index.html` file with any static web server so that the
browser can load the WebAssembly module.

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in a browser with WebGPU enabled.
